LESSON 1: 

    (basic) What is JS: 
        - used to create websites 
    HTML creates the content: buttons, text, images
    CSS changes the appearence - makes it look nice
    JS:
        - Makes the website interactive; clickable buttons and such
        - adds products to the cart, etc.. creates order, etc.. 
        - givevs instruction to computer
        - computer follows instructions

    alert('') - gives popup alert box with message in ()
    always use ; just like in java 

    JS console does math - just like any other
    Case sensitive 

    document.body.innerHTML = 'hello' --- will modify the webpage do just say 'hello'

    JS modifies websites - biggest point

LESSON 2 - Numbers and Math:
    * = multiply
    / = division
    can handle decimal 
    follows order of operations
    operator precedence
    how to round a number:
        Math.round()

LESSON 3 - STRINGS:
    can add strings together with + 
    numbers/strings are types of values
    typeof will show type
    javascript adds from left to right
    '$' + 20.95 + 7.99 will first convert to string and combine
    3 ways to create string: 
        - ' ' (use by default)
        - " " (use if single quote in string)
        - Escape Character - \'
            "I\'m learning JavaScript"
            \n = newline Character
            Interpolation - `Items (${1 + 1}): $${(2095 + 799) / 100}`
            inserts values into strings
            ${}
            ` ` = template string == more features but ' ' is default 

LESSON 4 - HTML/CSS/JS implementation: 
    HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
         - write inside of a file using VScode
         <button></button> = creates button in HTML
         ^^ called an element: <> html tag </>
         newlines count as spaces 
         any # of spaces is only one space 
    
        - <head> </head> == where you store the attributes of the html 
        - <body> </body> == where you store the visible things on the website

    CSS - cascading style sheets
        - changes the style of any element

LESSON 5 - VARIABLES: 
    - don't need to declare the type
    - start with 'let' 
        let variable1 = 3;
    - name restrictions: 
        -cant use special words like: 
            -let
        -cant start with number
        -cant use speical characters except: 
            $ or _
    - don't use let when reassigning
    - const == can't change the value of the variable1
    - var == has some issues and dont use it in js anymore

LESSON 6 - Booleans/If statements: 
    - true/false
    - syntax rules for boolean: 
        - write true/false
        - === equal to
        - == equal to but will convert to same type (5 == "5.0") - not a good idea because you don't want it to convert, so always use triple equals 
        - !== not eqaul to, dont use !=
        - comparison operators have lower priority than math operators
    
    - if/else very similar to java: 
        - don't need curly if only one line
        - else if 

    -Math.random() will randomly choose a number between 0 <= # < 1 
    - {} provides a scope to get rid of naming confilcts
    - var doesn't follow scope: 
        - conflicts with names
    -truthy/falsey values: 
        - false: 0 '' NaN undefined null
        -      const cartQuantity = 0;
      if(cartQuantity){
        console.log('Cart has products');
      }
      else{
        console.log('Cart is empty');
      }


      console.log('text'/5); //NaN
      let variable1;
      console.log(variable1); //undefined (must be with let)

    - turnary operator: acts as a if/else with boolean
