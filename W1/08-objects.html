     const product = {
        name: 'socks',
        price: 1090      
     }

     console.log(product);
     console.log(product.name); 
     console.log(product.price);

     product.name = 'cotton socks';
     console.log(product.name);
     console.log(product);

     product.newProperty = true;
     console.log(product);

     delete product.newProperty;
     console.log(product);

     
      Syntax rules: 
        -code on left of is called property
        -property value pair
        -seperate with comma
        -dot notation allows you to acces a property
          - also allows you to change the product with = 
          - also allows you to add
          - also allows you to delete

      Why use them? 
        -objects make the code organized 
        -allow us to use multiple values together
          -no need to console log each item individual
        
     
      const product2 = {
        name: 'shirt',
        'delivery-time': '1 day',
        rating:{ //nested object
          stars: 4.5,
          count: 87 
        },
        fun: function function1(){ // method
          console.log('function inside object');
        }
      }
      
      console.log(product2['name']); //bracket notation same as dot
      console.log(product2['delivery-time']);
      console.log(product2.fun());


      console.log(JSON.stringify(product2)); //stringify results in a string JS object to JSON object conversion 

      const jsonString = JSON.stringify(product2);
      console.log(JSON.parse(jsonString)); // JSON to JS object conversion
      
        when to use bracket notation: 
          - when there are - in the name
        which should we use?
          - dot notation by default 
          - if needing to use properties that dont work with dot, use bracket 
        
        methods are within objects: 
          - with console.log() - console is an object, log is a function - makes a method 
          - with Math.random() - Math is an object - random() is a function - method
        
        console/math are BUILT IN objects - provided by JS 

        - 2 more objects - JSON and Built in storage

        JSON - JavaScript Object Notation: 
          - a syntax 
          - similar to js object
          - has less features
          - must use ""
          - does not allow functions!
          - WHY use JSON?
            - JSON can be understood by almost every language, JSON is more universal 
            - Use JSON when sending data between computers that might use other languages 
            - Use JSON for storage!!!!!! 

        Local Storage: 
          - normally, when you refresh the page, variables are reset back to their normal state when they run the code 
          - When you need values saved, even when you refresh the page, you need local storage! 
          - Only supports strings

      console.log('hello'.length);
      console.log('hello'.toUpperCase())

      const object1 = {
        message: 'hello'
      };

      const object2 = object1; //makes a copy of the reference
      //Copy by reference

      object1.message = 'Good Job!'; //changes the value even tho const because you can still access the reference
      console.log(object1);
      console.log(object2); //still shows the change even tho its object1 because its just a reference

      const object3 = {
        message: 'Good Job!'
      }

      console.log(object3 === object1); //not equal because they are two different references. 
      console.log(object2 === object1); //equal because we made them the same reference above. 

      const object4 = {
        message: 'Good Job!',
        price: 799
      }

      //const message = object4.message;

      const { message, price } = object4; //called destruction. takes the properties out of the object and saves to message/price. 

      console.log(price,message);

      const object5 = {
        //message: message
        message, //SHORTHAND property
        //method: function function1(){
        //  console.log('method');
        //} SHORTHAND METHOD
        method(){
          console.log('method');
        }
      }

      console.log(object5)
      object5.method();

      /*
        Auto Boxing: 
          - when typing a string, JS creates a special object 
          to allow you to use properties like length
          - Also works with other types of values 
            like numbers and boolean 

        Objects Continued: 
          - Objects are references
          - first stored in memory, 
          and then directed to that place by the variable
